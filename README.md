## Notes
- The assumption was made that every record is potentially a unique user. If at least one of its fields is present, it should be included in the datastore. 
- This repository contains a pre-generated SQLite datastore based on the parsed_data.txt file, but a new one can be generated by running the setup-datastore.js script.

## Usage
    $ node scripts/setup-datastore.js
    $ node scripts/search-by-keyword.js KEYWORD
    $ node scripts/search-by-uid.js UID

## Parsing
In an attempt to reduce the amount of data being written to the datastore, the following parsing decisions were made.

### IP Address and User Agent
Kept as is, if present

### URL and Referer 
Split into three segments.

#### Host
- Strip protocol
- Split at "."s
- Remove "www"
- Remove common domain extensions

#### Pathname
- Ignore empty paths "/"
- Remove "/", "=", "-", "_", "&", "|", "," and ";"
- Remove common domain extensions
- Remove common file extensions
- Ignore keyword if length < 3 (decision made after analyzing usefulness of [this file](https://github.com/diegonetto/simplifi-quiz/blob/master/keywords-under-three-characters.txt)'s contents)

#### Query
- Parse params from query
- Use values of "q", "query", "refer", "referer", "referrer", and "search_query" keys

## Benchmarks
Since optimizations were to be made for seach efficiency, an SQLite [FTS4](http://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html) table was used for fast full text seaching of the keywords property. The trade-off is that a FTS4 table takes longer to initally build and uses up more space on disk than an ordinary SQLite table.
